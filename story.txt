Jonathan, the shark, lives under the sea.
Jonathan had many fellow sea friends, even Sarah the Sea Urchin. Sarah and
Jonathan had many sea adventures together. Their favorite game was hide and
seek, and there was always somewhere new to hide.

Sarah the Sea Urchin was terrible at hide and seek, however, for she did not have eyes.
Sarah did not have fins either, so she could not move far. Jonathan eventually got 
bored of playing with Sarah, so the playing eventually stopped. Sarah's only remaining 
friend was Sam the Sea Cucumber.
